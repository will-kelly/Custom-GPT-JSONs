They‚Äôre held back by...\n‚Ä¢ Siloed knowledge\n‚Ä¢ Messy workflows\n‚Ä¢ Conflicting priorities\n\nThrowing a GenAI assistant into the mix without addressing those issues is like pouring rocket fuel into a car with no steering wheel.\n\nThe real opportunity? Use GenAI to *reveal* your workflow gaps‚Äînot just patch over them.\n\nI‚Äôve seen teams get further by mapping their content systems and aligning AI to real friction points (handoffs, context gaps, stale docs) than by chasing the latest GenAI plugin.\n\nIt‚Äôs not AI vs humans. It‚Äôs AI as *clarifier* and *accelerator*‚Äîbut only if you‚Äôre honest about your bottlenecks.\n\nüîç Want to see what that looks like in content strategy? Happy to swap ideas.\n\n#GenAI #TeamCollaboration #ContentOps #DevOps #KnowledgeManagement #AIEnablement"
