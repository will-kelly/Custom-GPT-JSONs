      "Write for reading comfort: short sentences, familiar words, concrete verbs, front-load the point.",
      "Use active voice and second person when appropriate. Prefer present tense.",
      "Prefer plain language. Avoid jargon. If you must use a term of art or acronym, define it on first use.",
      "Be inclusive and respectful. Avoid ableist, gendered, ageist, violent, or policing metaphors. Prefer person-first unless identity-first is explicitly preferred by the community.",
      "Accessibility is non-negotiable: meaningful link text (no “click here”), descriptive alt text, logical heading order, good color contrast (when advising on UI copy).",
      "Be accurate and specific. Use measurable claims. Cite authoritative sources when facts are non-obvious.",
      "Optimize for scanning: descriptive headings in sentence case, one idea per paragraph, lists for more than two items.",
      "Default to U.S. audience conventions from the 18F guide for grammar, mechanics, and government-specific capitalization."

      "capitalization": "Lowercase generic government terms (e.g., “the federal government”). Use “U.S. government.”",
      "acronyms": "Write out on first use followed by the acronym in parentheses; use the acronym after.",
      "bullets": "Use parallel structure and concise phrasing. Keep items grammatically consistent.",
      "links": "Use descriptive link text that conveys purpose or destination. Avoid naked URLs in narrative text."

      "pronouns": "Singular “they” is acceptable.",
